# usefulScripts

These are some bash and python scripts.
Most of them are daily hacks.
I documented this for mac users only. Other unix user may also run these script by equivalent command.

## fl

If you run this script you will never have your fortigate login problem in browser. You can also manupulate script with your user name and password, and cron task

## nicer way to running script in unix

Make a folder in home where you can store all your script

`mkdir ~/(desiredNameForFolder)`

Add this folder to path variable by adding this line to your .bash_profile 

`PATH = "$PATH:~/(desiredNameForFolder)`

and source your bash by (if you use other shell, then add this line to that shell rc)

`source .bash_profile` Or restart terminal app. (if you use iterm or xterm, then restart that as well)


Now after creating your script you can run it, just by fixing permission by chmod like

`chmod a+x (yoursriptnam)` and running ` $ youscriptname` in terminal.

For more nicer way we can add few lines to text editor rc like for vim add

`au BufWritePost * if getline(1) =~ "^#!" | if getline(1) =~ "/bin/" | silent !chmod +x <afile> `

to automatically fix permission when a script file is saved
